# Arduino Experimental Projects

## Overview

### What are those projects?
These are a collection of small projects created while learning Arduino. Each one focuses on a specific component or concept.

### Goals
My primary goal is to build a strong foundation in Arduino development, gaining a good understanding of its capabilities and features, and then I expect to apply this knowledge to create some interesting integrations with Unity.

## Navigating the repository

### Folder Structure
The projects in the "Arduino-IDE-Projects" folder were created using the official Arduino IDE and are generally simpler experiments.

The projects in the "PlatformIO-Projects" folder were created with PlatformIO, using the plugin on VS Code, and are typically more complex ideas (for example: more Unity integration).
